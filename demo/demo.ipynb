    "## Tool description\n",
    "In short, the Graph-Optimizer tool performs the following functions:\n",
    "- Predicts the execution time (in milliseconds) and energy consumption (in Joules) for a given BGO or DAG of BGOs on a specific hardware configuration.\n",
    "- Returns the model in symbolical form with graph properties as symbols or predicts execution times if the graph properties are specified.\n",
    "- This is done via an API where issuing a POST request to `<api_url>/models` with the BGO DAG and hardware configuration returns an annotated DAG with calibrated symbolical models. Calling `<api_url>/evaluate` with the BGO DAG, hardware configuration, and graph properties returns an annotated DAG with predicted execution times."

    "### What is a BGO?\n",
    "A BGO, or Basic Graph Operation, is an atomic graph operation, that can serve as a building block for constructing larger graph _workloads_.\n",
    "A single BGO can have multiple implementations, possibly targeting different hardware platforms (e.g., CPU or GPU).\n",
    "A workload is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of BGOs, where the nodes are BGOs and the edges represent data dependencies between them.\n",
    "An example of such a DAG is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"margin-bottom: -245px\" src=\"dag.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this DAG, we start with the Betweenness Centrality (BC) BGO, followed by the Breadth First Search (BFS) and Find Max BGO's. Finally, we have the Find Path BGO to conclude. This example is a workload that outputs the path from the root node to the node with the highest betweenness centrality, which is the most popular node in the graph."

    "### Performance modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Each implementation of a BGO has a symbolic model that describes its execution time and energy consumption as functions of graph properties and hardware characteristics. Specifically, these hardware characteristics refer to the execution times of atomic operations in hardware, or operations considered to be atomic, such as reading a value from memory, writing a value to memory, performing an integer addition, and so on. These characteristics are obtained through _microbenchmarks_ run on the hardware where the BGO will be executed. The values obtained from the microbenchmarks are used to calibrate the symbolic models, which then provide the execution time and energy consumption of the BGO based solely on the graph properties. This approach allows for predicting the execution time and energy consumption of a BGO on a specific hardware configuration without needing to run the BGO on the hardware for any particular input graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a calibrated model might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_{BGO} = 561n \\times 924m + 91n^2$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of nodes in a graph, $m$ is the number of edges in the graph, and $T_{BGO}$ is the execution time of the BGO in milliseconds."
